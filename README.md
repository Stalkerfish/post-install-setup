# post-install-setup
The few things you need to do is run in your terminal the following:


- clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/Stalkerfish/post-install-setup.git`

- navigate to the repo directory

`cd post-install-setup`

- then run the post-install script

`./post-install-setup.sh`

> after a while you will be prompted if you want to install some (gnome) extensions, and you should take a look (and edit) the 'links.txt' file, as it stores links to the extensions web pages that will be installed.

- if you want to install Viper4Linux to make amazing audio tweaks, just run:

`./installViper.sh`
